``Par4Sim`` -- Adaptive Paraphrasing for Text Simplification

## What is Par4Sim?

It is an adaptive semantic writing aid tool, based on the [SEMSCH](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/research/semsch.html) project with the following functionalities:
* Built-in paraphrasing for text simplification 
* Learns from `usage data` to build adaptive `ranking` models for text simplification
* Can be easily integrated to the `Amazon MTurk crowdsourcing`
