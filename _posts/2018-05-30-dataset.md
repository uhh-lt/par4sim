**Learning_to_Rank** Dataset collected in each iterations are found [here](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/par4sem/datasets/rank.tsv)

__File formats__: It is a **TAB** separated format where:
   * First column is HIT ID (so all sentences with the same HIT ID were assigned to one worker at MTurk)
   * Second column is the iteration number (at which Iteration this data is collected),
   * Third, fourth and fifth columns are the **sentence**, the **target unit** in the sentence, and the possible **candidate** suggestion respectively.
   * The sixth and the seventh columns are the offsets of the **target unit**  in the sentence.
   * The last column is the number of workers who choose the **candidate suggestion** for the given **target unit**.

**Complex word identification dataset**: It is based on CWI shared task from [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inf.uni-hamburg.de%2Fen%2Finst%2Fab%2Flt%2Fresources%2Fdata%2Fcomplex-word-identification-dataset%2Fcwishareddataset.zip&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHpoudY-VUBwmu40IEL2o1OeNQPbw).

The data are in the following format:

```
<ID> Both China and the Philippines flexed their muscles on Wednesday. 31 51 flexed their muscles 10 10 3 2 1 0.25
<ID> Both China and the Philippines flexed their muscles on Wednesday. 31 37 flexed 10 10 2 6 1 0.4
<ID> Both China and the Philippines flexed their muscles on Wednesday. 44 51 muscles 10 10 0 0 0 0.0
```
Each line represents a sentence with one complex word annotation and relevant information, each separated by a TAB character.

   * The first column shows the HIT ID of the sentence. All sentences with the same ID belong to the same HIT.
   * The second column shows the actual sentence where there exists a complex phrase annotation.
   * The third and fourth columns display the start and end offsets of the target word in this sentence.
   * The fifth column represents the target word.
   * The sixth and seventh columns show the number of native annotators and the number of non-native annotators who saw the sentence.
   * The eighth and ninth columns show the number of native annotators and the number of non-native annotators who marked the target word as difficult.
   * The tenth and eleventh columns show the gold-standard label for the binary and probabilistic classification tasks.
The labels in the binary classification task were assigned in the following manner:

   * 0: simple word (none of the annotators marked the word as difficult)
   * 1: complex word (at least one annotator marked the word as difficult)

The labels in the probabilistic classification task were assigned as __the number of annotators who marked the word as difficult__/__the total number of annotators__.

Details about the dataset is available in the [CWI Shared Task 2018](https://sites.google.com/view/cwisharedtask2018/datasets) dataset section.
